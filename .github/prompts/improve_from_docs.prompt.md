# API Documentation Code Improvement Prompt

## Context
I'm providing you with official API documentation (in HTML format) and my existing code implementation. Please directly improve my code based on the documentation. Dont stop until its done! Don't wait for my feedback, don't ask wether to continue.

## Objectives
1. Analyze the provided API documentation thoroughly
2. Compare it with my existing code implementation
3. Directly implement changes to align my code with the official documentation
4. Add missing features or functionality described in the documentation
5. Optimize existing implementations where possible
6. Add new module if needed

## Implementation Instructions:
- Make changes directly to the code, not just suggestions
- Reference the specific section of the API documentation that informed your changes
- Focus on implementing the necessary changes without showing the previous code
- Provide clear comments explaining significant changes

## Areas to Address:
- Parameter handling and validation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting considerations
- Response parsing and handling
- Proper resource management
- Adherence to API conventions and best practices
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations

## Priorities:
1. Correctness - ensuring code works according to documentation
2. Completeness - implementing all available functionality
3. Robustness - handling errors and edge cases
4. Maintainability - clear, well-structured code
5. Performance - optimizing for efficiency

After reviewing my code and the documentation, please directly implement the necessary changes
